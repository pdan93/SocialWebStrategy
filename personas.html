                <p>Ashley always has been the "it girl". Being popular is her second nature. With rich parents, maids and a limo at her feet there is nothing else on the wish list. Her only preocupation is to be popular. She is constantly  on her phone, loves hearing about what celebrities do, their fashion preferences and their life.</p>
                <p>After finishing college, she dreams about being a fashion designer for the celebrities that she followed all her life.</p>
                <p>She spends her alone time online also. She chooses to do things related to what she loves: social life.</p>
                <p>Last week her best friend Carol told her about this game that everyone is playing called Tweeter Battles. When she heard that her followers on Tweeter can finally count for something she was really excited to try it.</p>
                <p>She was very happy that games and social media can be so cool together.</p>

                <li>Ashley and Carol are in her limo on the way home. Ashley gets bored talking about school and starts playing on her phone. Carol is pissed because she's ignored, but because Ashley is popular she feels like she can't say anything. Instead she sends her an invite to battle on the new Twitter Battles.</li>
                <li>Ashley is at home watching tv when she suddenly sees her favorite singer (Bieber of course). Being filled of stupid emotions she goes on the Twitter battles app and selects him as her character. She's determined to win</li>
                <li>Attending a boring course, which of course Ashley doesn't care about, an invite from an anonymous opponent appears on her phone. She starts playing the game and loses. She then hears laughter behind. She recognizes Mark and invites him to a rematch.</li>

                <p><strong></strong></p>
                <p>Alex is 24 years old and works as a software engineer for a big company. Because of the environment in the company Alex always feels he has to be better then others. He enjoys competition, playing games and winning makes him feel validated.</p>
                <p>Since he was a child he dreamed about having his own place. About 1 year ago he was promoted and his income increased. He thought about making a loan.</p>
                <p>He just bought a new apartment and he really needs the money so he works as many shifts as he can. Therefore for him breaks are very important because he needs to recover his strenght in order to be able to continue working.</p>
                <p>Alex is now very happy with his own place, but he has to work very much and is tired all the time. He can't take big breaks, so one of the few parts of the day he relaxes a bit is when he tries new mobile or internet games.</p>
                <p>He always prefered games that just distracted him but didn't take long and didn't create obsession, making him want to play the game all the time.</p>
                <p>Recently Alex met Diana. He feels that this relationship is nothing like he ever felt before so he does his best to make it work. Diana is a very social person and she enjoys talking about hollywood celebrities and their life. </p>
                <p>Alex just heard about this cool new game that lets you select a celebrity account on twitter and play as him/her. The game is fun enough for Alex to get his small break kick out of it and at the same time he gets to play it with Diana who loves it.</p>

                <li>Alex just met his new colleague Bob and because they're alone in the office and they have nothing to talk about so Alex starts telling him about the game. Hearing about the battle part, Bob is willing to try it to.</li>

                <p>Teodora grew up on a poor farm in Romania. She learned how to live from what she produces around home. School was not something her parents were caring about. She finished primary school and after that she started to learn how to cook, wash, clean and care for the farm. Being the only child, she needed to learn those things in order to keep the farm after her parents won't be around anymore.</p>
                <p>She got married young and started a family on the farm.</p>
                <p>When her kids grow up, she wanted them to focus on education in order to succeed and have an easier life than she had. They moved to the city and after they got jobs, they convinced her to move too in order to be closer together.</p>
                <p>Soon she became a grandmother. It was one of the happiest days of her life. Seeing her family growing and happy was her dream. Seeing her grandchildren she decided that she will dedicate her strength to help raise them healthy. </p>
                <p>She wasn't happy when her grandchildren started to play some game on their phone called Tweeter Battles. They were spending too much time on those electronic devices but she knew that it was a new world and everybody was "on the line"(she means online).</p>

When dinner was ready she went to get the boys but before being able to say something Danny jumped and said "Rematch!" and immediately after Rob said "Sure, i'll beat you again!" Knowing that they will not move until they finish the game she just went back to the kitchen thinking that some rules need to take place.</li>
                <li>Saturday morning the entire family was packing for a picnic in the parc. During the car drive the kids were very unsettled so their parents said that if they promise to enjoy the day without phones, they will allow them to play Tweeter Battles until getting to the parc. The kids thought it was  a great idea and the car drive went smoothly.</li>

                <p>Jennifer turns 28 years old this winter and her promotion is on the way. Everything is as planed. She wanted to be as successful as her father by the age of 30. He was the best sales man that New York has ever seen. He could sell anything and everything back in the days. </p>
                <p>Jenn is a kind person but she loves competition and her colleague Jeremy knows that. Since last year's fight between them about the new features for the Tweeter App, he is trying to beat her at everything. </p>
                <p>Luckily she just got a hint about this new game that is not so popular among the young generation. She got an email from her sister Beth who can't stop playing it. Jenn did her research and found out that this could be the key to her winning once and for all the fight with Jeremy.</p>
                <p>If she could promote the game enough the Tweeter App would gain a great amount of traffic. She worked after hours all week and pulled it off.</p>
                <p>Now everybody was crazy about the game and was following tones of people in order to gain lives in the game. People were getting to be their favourite celebrity in this game. Tones of new account were made and her boss was over the moon. </p>
                <p>She got the promotion 2 months earlier and more than that, they made her head of her department(which meant that she was now Jeremy's new boss). </p>

            <h5>Scenarios</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Jenn was in the coffee shop and was waiting in line when a youg man behind her started to say:"Hurry up! We don't have all day!". He was bored so he couldn't wait to het the coffee quietly. Jenn turned around and asked him if he had heard about this new game everyone is crazy about. He started playing immediately and the arguing stopped. </li>
                <li>Just after her promotion was announced, Jeremy came to her asking how she managed to get it before him. She told him about the game with a great smile on her face. He congratulated her and started to download the game to try it out. </li>
